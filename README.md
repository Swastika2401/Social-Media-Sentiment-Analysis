# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
Analyzing public sentiment on Indian political leaders—Modi, Rahul Gandhi, and Kejriwal—using Twitter data. We cleaned tweets, applied sentiment analysis, and built an interactive Streamlit dashboard. A college minor project blending NLP, data science, and visualization.
The project offers real-time insights into public opinion trends, helping visualize how sentiment shifts across events and timelines.
